    <description summary="protocol for setting toplevel tags">
      In order to make some window properties like position, size, "always on top"
      or user defined rules for window behavior persistent, the compositor needs
      some way to identify windows even after the application has been restarted.
      This protocol allows clients to make this possible by setting a tag for
      toplevels.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        Set a tag for a toplevel. The tag may be shown to the user in UI, so it's preferable for
        it to be human readable. Suitable tags would for example be "main window", "settings",
        "e-mail composer" or similar.

        The tag does not need to be unique across applications, and the client may set the same
        tag for multiple windows, for example if the user has opened the same UI twice.
        How the potentially resulting conflicts are handled is compositor policy.

        If a tag is set at all, the client must set the tag as part of the initial commit on the
        associated toplevel. If the toplevel is already mapped, or the following wl_surface.commit
        after this request maps the surface, the tag_on_mapped error is emitted.
